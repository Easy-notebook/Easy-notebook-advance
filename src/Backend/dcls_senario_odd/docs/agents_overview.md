# VDSAgents System Overview

## System Architecture

VDSAgents is a PCS-guided multi-agent system for Veridical Data Science automation, grounded in the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles. The system implements a modular and interpretable workflow that decomposes the data science lifecycle (DSLC) into five dedicated agents.

## Agent Architecture

The system consists of five specialized agents working collaboratively:

### 1. Define-Agent (ùíú_define)
**Role**: Problem formulation and dataset quality evaluation
- Formulates the data science problem based on initial requirements
- Evaluates dataset characteristics and quality metrics
- Establishes project objectives and constraints
- Defines success criteria and evaluation frameworks

### 2. Explore-Agent (ùíú_explore) 
**Role**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis
- Handles comprehensive data cleaning operations
- Performs data preprocessing and transformation
- Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generates data visualizations and statistical summaries
- Identifies data patterns, anomalies, and structural characteristics

### 3. Model-Agent (ùíú_model)
**Role**: Feature engineering and predictive modeling
- Performs advanced feature engineering and selection
- Trains and optimizes machine learning models
- Conducts model comparison and selection
- Implements ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning
- Generates predictions on test datasets

### 4. Evaluate-Agent (ùíú_evaluate)
**Role**: Model performance assessment and result interpretation
- Evaluates model performance using comprehensive metrics
- Conducts statistical significance testing
- Interprets model results and generates insights
- Validates model generalization capabilities
- Produces final performance reports

### 5. PCS-Agent (ùíú_PCS)
**Role**: Cross-stage PCS principle enforcement and stability analysis
- **Predictability**: Ensures models generalize to new data
- **Computability**: Emphasizes practical feasibility and reproducibility
- **Stability**: Tests sensitivity through perturbation analysis
- Operates across all stages to maintain scientific rigor
- Generates multiple perturbed datasets for robustness testing
- Validates reproducibility and consistency of results

## Key Design Principles

### PCS-Guided Workflow
The system is structured around the three core PCS principles:
- **Predictability**: Models must demonstrate reliable generalization
- **Computability**: Solutions must be practically implementable and reproducible
- **Stability**: Results must remain robust under reasonable perturbations

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Each agent has specialized expertise aligned with DSLC stages
- Agents maintain shared memory for context preservation
- The PCS-Agent provides continuous oversight and validation
- Standardized interfaces enable seamless agent communication

### Tool Infrastructure
The system includes an extensible toolkit:
- **ML Function Library**: Modular data processing and modeling functions
- **Unit Testing**: Systematic validation of data integrity
- **Code Execution & Debugging**: Reliable code execution with error recovery
- **Image-to-Text**: Visual analysis support for EDA outputs
- **Perturbation Tools**: Automated stability testing mechanisms

## Workflow Process

1. **Problem Definition**: Define-Agent formulates the problem and assesses data quality
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore-Agent cleans data and performs EDA with PCS oversight
3. **Model Development**: Model-Agent engineers features and trains models
4. **Result Evaluation**: Evaluate-Agent assesses performance and interprets results
5. **PCS Validation**: PCS-Agent conducts perturbation analysis and stability testing throughout
